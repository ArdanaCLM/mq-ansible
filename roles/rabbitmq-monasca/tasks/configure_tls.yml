# NOTE(gyee): Since the provisioned TLS server certificate is consisted of
# both certificate and private key, we need to separate out the certificate
# protion for monitoring without having to compromise the private key.
# This is done by copying the certificate to a different file and make it
# readable by the world. Making certificate readable by the world is NOT a
# problem as it is TLS certificate is public information.
